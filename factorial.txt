; computes factorial of number N located on stack (the one under the return address)
; result of the func is in the rax
; ATTENTION! Uses following registers: rax rbx rdx
fact:
    pop rdx         ; saving return address

                    ; now top number on stack is N
    pop rbx         ; saving N to rbx

    push rbx
    push 1
    je fact_equal_  ; if N equals 1, then result of the func is 1, else fact(N-1)*N

    push rdx        ; saving for later
    push rbx        ; saving for later
